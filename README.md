# 👋 Hi there, I'm grML!

I'm a passionate software developer who loves building things with code. I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end projects, and I'm always up for learning something new.

I have worked on projects involving the linux kernel, low level projects, system administration and basic full stack web apps.
I intend to skill myself beyond what the classroom teaches me.
"grML" is pronounced "Ger-Merl".

## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 I’m currently working with: Java and Nodejs (ew)
- 🌱 Planning to learn (relearn): C, ASMs (NASM family), Golang, Rust, Zig and Python. 
- 🛠️ Favorite tools: Neovim, VSC and Eclipse tools for Java. Portainer and Coolify for docker-related deployments.

## 📈 Story

I used to do low level stuff and I kind of just forgot it all. ;-;
Have a love-hate relationship with nodejs.
