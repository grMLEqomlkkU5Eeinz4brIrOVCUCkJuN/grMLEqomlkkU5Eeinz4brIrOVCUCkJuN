# 👋 Hi, I'm grML!

I'm a passionate software developer with experience in both front-end and back-end development. I specialize in low-level programming, system administration, and full-stack web applications. My goal is to continually grow my skills beyond traditional classroom learning and stay updated with the latest technologies.

**Pronunciation:** "grML" is pronounced "Ger-Merl".

## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 Currently working with: Java and Node.js
- 🌱 Actively learning/relearning: C, Assembly (NASM family), Go, Rust, Zig, and Python
- 🛠️ Favorite tools: Neovim, VSCode, Eclipse (for Java), Portainer, and Coolify (for Docker-related deployments)

## 📈 Professional Journey

I have a background in low-level programming and system administration, and I am continuously expanding my expertise in modern development frameworks and tools. While I have a complex relationship with Node.js, I am always eager to tackle new challenges and grow in the tech space.

Occasionally, you may notice "Added files via upload" in my Git commits due to an issue with the Git helper core on Windows after some WSL conflicts.
